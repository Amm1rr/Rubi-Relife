## What is Rubi?

In today's world, various methods exist for learning English. These include language classes, multimedia CDs, books, and numerous other approaches. The drawbacks of using each of these methods include the need to spend money, waste time and effort, and a relatively long learning curve. More importantly, most conventional methods are very tedious and monotonous, and learners usually find them unengaging, which leads to them getting discouraged and giving up on the learning process after a while. In this context, Rubi, which is both interesting and engaging for the individual, leads to the desired result quickly, and is also inexpensive and affordable, is the only method for learning English using the Rubi software.

## How Does English Language Learning Work in Rubi Software?

The human brain, through the repetition of an analyzable event, initially transfers its understanding to short-term memory and then, in a shorter time frame, to long-term memory, essentially making it a part of the mind. Rubi software leverages this capability of the human brain for English language learning. It does this by presenting a valuable collection of everyday sentences, idioms, and various topics, with a specific combination and adjustable timing, in the form of a repeatable event. As a result, after a short period, it will be permanently stored in your long-term memory.
